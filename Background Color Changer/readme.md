# 🌈 Background Changer using JavaScript

This is a simple and interactive Background Changer project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With this application, users can dynamically change the background color of the webpage by clicking on one of the pre-defined color options.

## 🚀 Features

- **Dynamic Background Color:** Change the background color of the webpage instantly with just a click.
- **Interactive UI:** Displays clickable color boxes for an intuitive experience.
- **Customizable:** Add or modify colors easily in the JavaScript file.

## 🖼️ Demo

Example of the color-changing functionality.

## 🕠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML:** For structuring the webpage.
- **CSS:** For styling the layout and color boxes.
- **JavaScript:** For adding interactive behavior to the webpage.

## 📂 File Structure

```plaintext
🗋 Background-Changer
├── index.html        # Main HTML file
├── style.css         # CSS file for styling
└── script.js         # JavaScript file for functionality
```

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. A predefined array of colors is created in the JavaScript file.
2. For each color, a clickable box is dynamically added to the webpage.
3. When a user clicks on a color box, the background color of the webpage changes to the corresponding color.

## 💻 How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/background-changer.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project folder:**
   ```bash
   cd background-changer
   ```

3. **Open `index.html` in your browser:**
   ```bash
   open index.html
   ```

## ✨ How to Add More Colors

To add more colors:

1. Open `script.js`.
2. Add new color codes to the `colorarray`:
   ```javascript
   let colorarray = ["#e58e26", "#f9b4ab", "#B1FB17", "#78e08f", "#fd79a8", "#6c5ce7", "#00cec9"];
   ```

## 🔧 Future Enhancements

- Add a "Reset" button to revert to the default background color.
- Allow users to input custom colors.
- Add animations or transitions when changing background colors.
