# My Web Development Projects

Welcome to my project repository! ðŸš€

## About This Repository
This repository contains all the projects I developed during my web development course. As a passionate developer, I love exploring new technologies and building exciting projects. Most of the code here is written in JavaScript because I was particularly interested in learning and mastering JavaScript more than anything else.

## My Skills & Tech Stack
I am a Full Stack Developer, primarily focused on the **MERN Stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). With expertise in both **frontend and backend development**, I can build complete web applications from scratch.

## What Youâ€™ll Find Here
- A collection of my **frontend and backend projects**
- Various **JavaScript-based applications**
- Full-stack **MERN applications**
- **Real-world projects** that demonstrate my skills

## My Future Plans
I am on a mission to build **insane projects** and take my profile to the next level. More and more projects are coming soon, so **stay tuned!** ðŸš€ðŸ”¥

If you find my projects useful or interesting, feel free to fork, star, and contribute. Letâ€™s build something amazing together!
